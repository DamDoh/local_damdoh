            "<strong>Cover & Label:</strong> Lightly cover the seeds with more mix. Label your containers clearly with the crop name and planting date.",
            "<strong>Water Gently:</strong> Water the surface gently with your spray bottle to ensure good seed-to-soil contact.",

            "<strong>Water Correctly:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. It's best to water from the bottom by placing your trays in a shallow pan of water. This encourages strong root growth.",
            "<strong>Thin Seedlings:</strong> Once the seedlings have their first set of 'true leaves' (the second set that appears), choose the strongest seedling in each cell and snip the others at the soil line with scissors. Do not pull them out, as this can disturb the roots of the remaining seedling.",
            "<strong>Fertilize Lightly:</strong> After 3-4 weeks, you can begin feeding your seedlings with a half-strength liquid organic fertilizer, such as fish emulsion or compost tea, once a week."
